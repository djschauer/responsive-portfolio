                Hello, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Daniel Schauer, and I am an aspiring web developer and this website, built by me, is a place where I can show off some of the work I have done. My background isn't originally in web development, but I have always had an interest in learning coding or tech. So, while this is new for me, I am an eager learner, and excited for the journey ahead. Feel free to explore my works in the portfolio section or contact me via the contact form.

                A little about me: I grew up in Minnesota, where I still currently live. I most recently lived over seas in Aberdeen Scotland, where I got my Master's degree in creative writing. I also have a BA in English and Creative Writing from the Hamline University in St. Paul Minnesota. At Hamline, I also spent several j-terms abroad, one studying King Arthur and the other traversing through former soviet satellite countries studying communist museums.Plus, I spent an entire semester living in York, England.

                I spend most of my free time, the little I have these days, reading and writing. Writing is my passion, primarily poetry, and I have had a couple of my poems published in various magazines. I also brew beer, and work at a liquor store, so my knowledge of all kinds of alcoholic beverages is pretty vast. I enjoy exploring the Twin Cities, going to breweries, shows and plays with my friends. I am an avid baker, and trying to explore cooking as well. I love hosting my friends so they can try my beer or some wine I have in my cellar and taste my various cooking experiements. I also enjoy playing board games and some video games when I get the chance.
